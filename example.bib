	Abstract = {Examining age differences in motor learning using real-world tasks is often problematic due to task novelty and biomechanical confounds. Here, we investigated how children and adults acquire a novel motor skill in a virtual environment. Participants of three different age groups (9-year-olds, 12-year-olds, and adults) learned to use their upper body movements to control a cursor on a computer screen. Results showed that 9-year-old and 12-year-old children showed poorer ability to control the cursor at the end of practice. Critically, when we investigated the movement coordination, we found that the lower task performance of children was associated with limited exploration of their movement repertoire. These results reveal the critical role of motor exploration in understanding developmental differences in motor learning.},

	Abstract = {Environmental psychologists have used Gibson' concept of affordances to understand the playing behavior of children. This concept refers to the action possibilities the environment offers the animal. The present study examined whether children are attracted to challenging affordances in a simple playscape. Thirty children aged between 7 and 10 years old played freely in a playscape consisting of blocks that varied in height and were placed at different distances from each other. After the playing, several perceived and actual action boundaries of the children were measured. The further the child can jump, the wider the gaps jumped across. Yet, overall the children tended to actualize affordances that were not challenging for them. Moreover, especially in going down and in crossing gaps of certain widths, children preferred to jump even when stepping was possible. The implications of these findings are explored for both theories of playing and the design of playgrounds.},

@article{Vasudevan2011,
	Abstract = {New walking patterns can be learned over short timescales (i.e., adapted in minutes) using a split-belt treadmill that controls the speed of each leg independently. This leads to storage of a modified spatial and temporal motor pattern that is expressed as an aftereffect in regular walking conditions. Because split-belt walking is a novel task for adults and children alike, we used it to investigate how motor adaptation matures during human development. We also asked whether the immature pattern resembles that of people with cerebellar dysfunction, because we know that this adaptation depends on cerebellar integrity. Healthy children (3-18 years old) and adults, and individuals with cerebellar damage were adapted while walking on split belts (1:2 speed ratio). Adaptation and de-adaptation rates were quantified separately for temporal and spatial parameters. All healthy children and adults tested could learn the new timing at the same rate and showed significant aftereffects. However, children younger than 6 years old were unable to learn the new spatial coordination. Furthermore, children as old as age 11 years old showed slower rates of adaptation and de-adaptation of spatial parameters of walking. Young children showed patterns similar to cerebellar patients, with greater deficits in spatial versus temporal adaptation. Thus, although walking is a well-practiced, refined motor skill by late childhood (i.e., 11 years of age), the processes underlying learning new spatial relationships between the legs are still developing. The maturation of locomotor adaptation follows at least two time courses, which we propose is determined by the developmental state of the cerebellum.},
